#THis exercise teaches about else and if

people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

if cars > people:
    print("We should take the cars")
elif cars<people:
    print("We should not cars")
else :
    print("we can\'t decide")

if trucks > cars:
    print("That's too many trucks")
elif trucks < cars:
    print("Maybe we could take the trucks.")
else:
    print("We still can't decide")
